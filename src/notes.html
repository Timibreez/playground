HTML BASICS

MARKUP:
Markup is simply Text with special meaning.
NOTE that every element starts and ends with a tag, as in -
    <em>Hi there!</em> - element
    <em> - tag - opening/start tag
    </em> - tag - closing/end tag

    Tags start with "<" and end with ">", they are most times called angle brackets.
<p>VOID/EMPTY ELEMENTS
Elements that do not have or need a closing tag.
Such as:
    <br>
    <img src="" alt="">
When the browser sees whitespaces, it treats it as a single character, therefore in order to create
a line break that will show up in the browser, you will have to use the "<br>" tag.</p>
