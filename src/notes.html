HTML BASICS

<div>
MARKUP:
Markup is simply Text with special meaning.
NOTE that every element starts and ends with a tag, as in -
    <em>Hi there!</em> - element
    <em> - tag - opening/start tag
    </em> - tag - closing/end tag

    Tags start with "<" and end with ">", they are most times called angle brackets.
<p>VOID/EMPTY ELEMENTS
Elements that do not have or need a closing tag.
Such as:
    <br>
    <img src="" alt="">
When the browser sees whitespaces, it treats it as a single character, therefore in order to create
a line break that will show up in the browser, you will have to use the "<br>" tag.</p>

TYPOGRAPHY ELEMENTS
<mark>Figure out sub and sup</mark>
<sub>What do you do ?</sub>
<sup>Lets see</sup>
<p>After realizing its use, I thought I should use it in a math expression: n<sup>2</sup></p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Dealing with list</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Oluwarotimi</li>
        <li>Oyindamola</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Somehow she will be late</li>
            <li>Yet extremely reliable</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>note: "p" and "li" have optional closing tags</p>
    <p>This is simply because when the browser sees a different tag after the opening of these two tags above, it knows that thats the end of the "self closing tag"</p>
